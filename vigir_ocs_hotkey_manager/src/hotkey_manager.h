/*
 *HotkeyManager to centralize where Hotkeys are processed
 *
 * Note: cannot have a hotkey correspond to two different actions within the same main window. There will be a hotkey manager for map,main,and camera.
 *
 * naming convention for keyCombo = key+key+....+key
 * so ctrl and q is  ctrl+q
 *
 *
 * list of hotkeys..

 *
 * Could upgrade this manager by flagging bits in an int based on keys pressed.(gets rid of sorting)
